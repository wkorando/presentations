## What's in the Cache?! 

![](images/whats-in-the-box.png)

VV

## Start-up Phase

* Class data (pre-existing from CDS)
* Class loading and linking

VV

## Warm-up Phase

* Profiling code execution
* Object caching (in-progress)
* Code compilation (in-progress)

VV

## Demo!

VV

## Advantages

‚úÖ Preserves Java's dynamism 
<br/>
‚úÖ Platform independent
<br/>
‚úÖ Still have full JVM and JIT and can fall back if cache is incorrect

VV

## Java's Dynamism 

* Dynamic typing (array store checks, casting)
* Dynamic class loading and verification
* Dynamic class redefinition
* Dynamic compilation (JITting)
* Dynamic recompilation (deoptimization)
* Dynamic linkage and access control
* Dynamic dispatch (virtual methods)
* Dynamic introspection (instanceof, reflection)

VV

## Extra Work

‚öôÔ∏è Training Runs <br/>
‚öôÔ∏è Storing the cache <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ü§î Include in container image? <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ü§î Located in a shared volume? <br/>
