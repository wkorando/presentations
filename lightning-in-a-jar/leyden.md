## Project Leyden

![](images/leyden-jar.jpg)

Named after a Leyden jar (like JAR, Get it?!), which stored an electrical charge. 

Fun fact: was the first capacitor.

## Project Leyden Goals ðŸ¥…

1. Reduce startup time - Time until first useful work
2. Reduce warmup time - Time until application reaches "peak" performance
3. Reduce footprint - Reduce the memory usage of an application* **

\* Not a current priority

\** Will come with the tradeoff of increased disk space

VV

##### Application level:
* Reading config files
* Scanning for annotations
* Opening sockets, registering listeners
* Creating loggers

##### JVM level:
* Class loading, linking, and initialization
	* Reading classes from disk
	* Classfile validation and metadata construction
	* Running static initializers
* Interpretation
* Callsite linkage, constant pool resolution
* Profile gathering

### This Happens Everytime an Application Starts up

## Timeshifting Work

Achieve goals of reduced startup time, warmup, and (eventually) footprint by "timeshifting" work from the runtime phase, to the build phase and storing it in an AOT Cache.
