## Project Leyden Goals ðŸ¥…

1. Reduce startup time - Time until first useful work
2. Reduce warmup time - Time until application reaches "peak" performance
3. Reduce footprint - Reduce the memory usage of an application* **

\* Not a current priority

\** Will come with the tradeoff of increased disk space

## Timeshifting Work

Achieve goals of reduced startup time, warmup, and (eventually) footprint by "timeshifting" work from the runtime phase, to the build phase and storing it in an AOT Cache.
