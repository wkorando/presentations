## To Java [n] and Beyond!

Java 21 has come and gone, but the Java release train continues with Java 24!

In this presentation, we will briefly review key changes between Java 11 and 21, as they form an important foundation for where Java is heading. Once that foundation is laid, we will look at what has changed in Java since 21, updates to Project Loom with a focus on, Scoped Values and Structured Concurrency, and how they will rewrite the Java concurrency story. 

We will also cover other important changes including: Generational ZGC, the Foreign Function and Memory API, JavaDoc updates, and even take a look into the future of where Java is heading!
