Provide a better more structure of what is happening

After going through current concurrent examples, step through the issues with them

* Error handling
* Cancel propagation
* Unconstrained
* Hung processes

Give high level examples of how Structured Concurrency addresses -> then get into code examples

Examples of debugging with tools like JMC? Finding hung process and relating them back to parent thread?
