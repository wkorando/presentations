My "Reproducible" Takeaways 

Invest in your network, particularly outside your current employer

Keyhole Software -> hired through a friend
IBM -> hired through a friend
Oracle -> hired through a friend

Climbing the career (and compensation) ladder

Annual compensation rarely tracks with market

Best way to increase annual earnings is by switching organizations

Switching organizations also comes with other great benefits:
* Expanding experience
* Expanding network
* Expanding life experience 

When switching roles

The grass isn't always greener

Companies "inflate" 
 
Having strong connections will help to circumvent many of the arbitrary resume screens that companies use 

How to invest in your network?

Actively participate in professional groups

Actively participate in the hallway track at conferences

Interact with the sponsors who are hiring at conferences 

Avoid pigeonholing

A Good Work Environment is Worth A LOT
