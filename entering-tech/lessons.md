## Climbing the Career (and Compensation) Ladder

VV


### Climbing the Career (and Compensation) Ladder

* Annual compensation updates rarely keeps pace with market
	* It's not you, it's not personal, it's how (virtually all) organizations operate 
* Organizations can be a real mixed bag for promoting internally

### Climbing the Career (and Compensation) Ladder

In 2015 my compensation increased by ~50% because I changed jobs twice. 

(I didn't become a 50% better at my job over that period)

VV

### Climbing the Career (and Compensation) Ladder

Changing organizations often gives an opportunity to move up the career ladder. 

Also in 2015 went from mid-range developer -> to senior -> to architect.

### Climbing the Career (and Compensation) Ladder

Salary/compensation is always negotiatiable.

### Climbing the Career (and Compensation) Ladder

Additional benefits of changing organizations:

* Expand experience

When looking for the next jump, be aware of:

<br/>


* The grass isn't always "greener"
	* Organizations also often inflate/exaggerate the "cool" aspects of your role
* A good work environment is worth A LOT
	* Often your manager/supervisor will be the biggest factor in this

* Co-workers will have their own priorities

VV

Make an honest effort to figure something out, but don't hesitate to ask questions. 

Better to ask a question, than push a bug to production!

VV

### Communication

Some of the most productive conservation and learning opportunities have come from when I asked a "dumb" question. 

VV

### Communication

Frank and honest conversations with managers/co-workers can be important to a positive work environment.
