## To Java [n] and Beyond!

Java 21 has come and gone, and the Java release train continues with Java 22!

Still, we will look over the key changes that have come to Java in recent releases, briefly discuss what has changed from 11-17, and take time to focus on changes in 17+. 

Many key changes have come to Java in recent releases; virtual threads, pattern matching, records, Generational ZGC, and more, understanding the goals of these changes can be key to understanding where Java is now and where it is going in the future!

## Java to the Future!
Amber, Valhalla, Loom, Panama, oh my! These are the names of the OpenJDK projects that will be shaping the near-term future of Java. As these projects begin to deliver, what does this mean for the future of Java?

In this presentation, we will look at the goals of these OpenJDK projects, what has been delivered and is soon to be delivered with each project, and how Java developers can prepare for these future changes. 

If you are curious about the future of Java or get a deeper understanding of these projects, this is a presentation you want to check out!

## Why Developers Should Love Testing
We know that test automation is often discussed as a “best practice” in modern software development, but why should we love automated testing as a developer? In this presentation, we will learn how reliance on manual testing and processes for validation lies at the heart of some of the most challenging problems in software development. We will then cover practices and principles for developing reliable, portable, and maintainable automated tests. This will help developers not view automated testing as a chore but as a central aspect of our work that helps us deliver better customer service!

## Taking off With JDK Flight Recorder
Are you running into problems with Java applications in production? Not understanding what is eating up all your system resources? And throwing a bunch of System.out messages in your code is not helping? You should check out the JDK Flight Recorder (JFR). JFR is a powerful and low-overhead observability tool built into the JVM that can help you track down those performance issues and difficult-to-understand bugs. In this presentation, we will go through the basics of using JFR in your Java applications.
