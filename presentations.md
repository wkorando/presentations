## To Java [n] and Beyond!

Java 25 has been released, but the Java release train coninues chugging along with Java 26.

In this presentation we will start with a quick review of the key changes from 17-21 and how they have improved developer experience, performance, and  supporting Java applications in production. 

From there we will transition to changes to Java post-21 and how the various changes are bringing important stores into focus including; improved concurrency support, data-oriented programming, native support, and more! 



The Java platform is evolivng quickly to keep pace with the current needs of users, be sure to attend this presentation if you want to keep up!

⚠️ This presentation is updated with the current or next release once it has entered ramp-down phase 1, which usually happens about three months before the upcoming release.

## Why Developers Should Love Testing
We know that test automation is often discussed as a “best practice” in modern software development, but why should we love automated testing as a developer? In this presentation, we will learn how reliance on manual testing and processes for validation lies at the heart of some of the most challenging problems in software development. We will then cover practices and principles for developing reliable, portable, and maintainable automated tests. This will help developers not view automated testing as a chore but as a central aspect of our work that helps us deliver better customer service!

## Finding and Crushing Bugs and More with JFR

Some of the most difficult issues a developer will face are slow developing resources leaks, or errors that occur at infrequent intervals. When these happen, finding the root cause can be difficult, and a frequent recourse by developers is to add a lot of logging statements around suspected problem sites. What if I told you there was a better option, and that option already existed right in the JVM you are already running? JDK Flight Recorder, as its namesake suggests, is a low-overhead profiling and diagnostic tool that[s been built directly into the JDK since JDK 7. In this presentation we are going to look at how developers can leverage JFR's powerful API and reporting tools for tracking down those difficult bugs as well as how JFR can be incorporated into the development process.

## Java is Data!

Data is at the center of any organization. So it stands to reason that data should be at the center of how we design and write our Java applications. In this talk we are going to look at how recent changes to the Java language; Records, Pattern Matching, Seal Hierarchies, are enabling Java applications to be written in a Data-Oriented Programming (DOP) paradigm. We will look at the core concepts of DOP, and how it compares and contrasts with the OOP approach familiar to many Java developers.

## Loominated Java

Virtual Threads, the central feature of Project Loom, were released as a final feature in JDK 21! As great as virtual threads are, it's just the start of the story for Project Loom. With the vastly reduced cost of creating threads, comes new opportunities. 

In this presentation we will look at the  two other major features to be delivered by Project Loom; Structured Concurrency and Scoped Values, and how they will significantly improve the developer experience of writing, running, and debugging code the executes concurrently.

## Lightning in a JAR, Faster Startups and more with AOT!

Since microservices started gaining popularity the mid-2010's there has been an increased focus on improving startup performance in Java applications. While there are frameworks and runtime solutions for addressing this issue, they often come with drawbacks. Adopting a framework might require refactoring or rewriting an application, some runtime solutions come with specific technical constraints. Project Leyden, an OpenJDK project with the goals of reducing start up time, time to peak performance, and memory footprint is aiming to give Java developers these benefits, without requiring to them make the tradeoffs other solutions often require. Leyden works by performing a training run and storing the collected information in a cache that can be used on subsequent runs. In this talk we will look at how Leyden is already delivering on improving startup, how you can incorporate it into your projects, and what's coming in the future from Project Leyden!
