## Why Developers Should Love Testing
We know that test automation is often discussed as being a “best practice” in modern software development, but as a developer, why should we love automated testing? In this presentation we will learn how a reliance on manual testing and processes for validation lies at the heart of some of the most difficult problems in software development. We will then cover practices and principles for developing reliable, portable, and maintainable automated tests. This will help developers not view automated testing a chore, but a central aspect of our work that helps us deliver better services to customers!

## Taking off With JDK Flight Recorder
Running into problems with Java applications in production? Not understanding what is eating up all your system resources? And throwing a bunch of System.out messages in your code is not helping? You should check out the JDK Flight Recorder (JFR). JFR is a power and low-overhead observability tool built into the JVM that can help you track down those performance issues and difficult to understand bugs. In this webinar we will go through the basics of using JFR in your Java applications.
