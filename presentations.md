## To Java [n] and Beyond!

Java 21 has come and gone, but the Java release train continues with Java 23!

In this presentation, we will briefly review key changes between Java 11 and 21, as they form an important foundation for where Java is heading. Once that foundation is laid, we will look at what has changed in Java since 21, including the likely finalization of the two remaining big features of Project Loom, Scoped Values and Structured Concurrency, and how that will rewrite the story of concurrency in Java. 

We will also cover other important changes, including Generational ZGC, Java language updates, and the Foreign Function and Memory API, and even take a look into the future of where Java is heading!

## Java to the Future!
Amber, Valhalla, Loom, Panama, oh my! These are the names of the OpenJDK projects that will be shaping the near-term future of Java. As these projects begin to deliver, what does this mean for the future of Java?

In this presentation, we will look at the goals of these OpenJDK projects, what has been delivered and is soon to be delivered with each project, and how Java developers can prepare for these future changes. 

If you are curious about the future of Java or get a deeper understanding of these projects, this is a presentation you want to check out!

## Why Developers Should Love Testing
We know that test automation is often discussed as a “best practice” in modern software development, but why should we love automated testing as a developer? In this presentation, we will learn how reliance on manual testing and processes for validation lies at the heart of some of the most challenging problems in software development. We will then cover practices and principles for developing reliable, portable, and maintainable automated tests. This will help developers not view automated testing as a chore but as a central aspect of our work that helps us deliver better customer service!

## Taking off With JDK Flight Recorder
Are you running into problems with Java applications in production? Not understanding what is eating up all your system resources? And throwing a bunch of System.out messages in your code is not helping? You should check out the JDK Flight Recorder (JFR). JFR is a powerful and low-overhead observability tool built into the JVM that can help you track down those performance issues and difficult-to-understand bugs. In this presentation, we will go through the basics of using JFR in your Java applications.

## Loominated Java

Virtual Threads, the central feature of Project Loom, were released as a final feature in JDK 21! As great as virtual threads are, it's just the start of the story for Project Loom. With the vastly reduced cost of creating threads, comes new opportunities. 

In this presentation we will look at the next two major features to be delivered by Project Loom; Structured Concurrency and Scoped Values, and how they will significantly improve the developer experience of writing, running, and debugging code the executes concurrently.
