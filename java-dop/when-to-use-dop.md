### When to Use DOP

Data-Oriented Programming isn't as generally applicable as Object-Oriented Programming. 

DOP could be used within subsystems of an OOP application.

### Personal Opinion

* Not fully there yet on Data-Oriented Programming
* Need to work with it more in practice
* Value seems dependent on bad OOP
* Needs better definition
* Making illegal states unrepresentable and transparently modeling data very useful
