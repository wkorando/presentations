## What is Data-Oriented Programming?

### What is Object-Oriented Programming?

Modeling entities and processes through a combination of both state and behavior.

```java
public class Attendee{
	private String firstName;
	private String lastName;
	private String company;
	private String email;
	private AttendeeType attendeeType;//Standard Attendee, Workshop Attendee, Speaker, etc.
	private List<Presentation> favoritedPresentations;
	
	...
	
	public void addFavoritedPresentation(Presentation presentation){
		favoritedPresentations.add(presentation);
	}
	
	public void setEmail(String email){
		if(Validators.validEmail(email)){
			this.email = email;
		}
	}
	
	public void setAttendeeType(AttendeeType attendeeType){
		this.attendeeType = type;
	}
}

### What is Data-Oriented Programming?

Defining a system by its (immutable) data, that is then acted upon by operations.

### Defining Characteristics of DOP

* Model data immutably and transparently.
* Model the data, the whole data, and nothing but the data.
* Make illegal states unrepresentable.
* Separate operations from data.

(Not hard and fast universal rules)

### DOP isn't New

Popularized in the 2000's for console video game development.

Antecedents go back to the 70s; Expression Problem and distinction between abstract data types and objects.

### Expression Problem

When you are not the owner of the code, choose one:

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">

**Polymorphism** 

<br/>

* Add new subtypes
* Cannot add operations

<br/>

**Pattern Matching** 

<br/>

* Add operations
* Cannot add new subtypes

</div>
</div>
